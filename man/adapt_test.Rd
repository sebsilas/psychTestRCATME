\usage{
adapt_test(
  label,
  item_bank,
  show_item,
  stopping_rule = stopping_rule.num_items(n = NULL),
  opt = adapt_test_options()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{label}{(Character scalar, e.g. 'MDT')
A label for the test when saving the participant's results.}

\item{item_bank}{(Data frame, or coerceable to such)
Defines the item bank, the collection of items available
for administration during the adaptive test.
Each row should correspond to a different item.
Four columns are mandatory, corresponding to the
item's psychometric parameters according to item response theory:
\itemize{
\item \code{discrimination} -
The item's discrimination parameter, with higher values
indicating that the item is better at discriminating between participants.
\item \code{difficulty} -
The item's difficulty parameter, with higher values
corresponding to harder items.
\item \code{guessing} -
The item's guessing parameter, corresponding to the probability
that a participant with no ability can nevertheless answer the
item correctly.
\item \code{inattention} -
The item's inattention parameter, corresponding to the probability
that a participant with infinite ability answers the question
correctly.
}

The data frame must also contain a column called \code{answer},
defining the correct answer for each item.
These answers will be checked for equality with
the answer output from \code{show_item} using \code{==},
which coerces to a shared class
(e.g. numeric answers can be coerced to character answers).
List-columns are not permitted.

This argument must also provide sufficient information for presenting
a particular item to the participant.
When an item has been selected,
the corresponding row from the item bank is extracted and
passed to the \code{show_item} function,
another of the arguments to \code{adapt_test}.
The \code{show_item} function uses this row as a basis
to display the item to the participant.}

\item{show_item}{(Function, list, or psychTestR timeline)
This function defines the logic for administering an item
from its definition in \code{item_bank}.
This function may take two forms:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Single-page items} -
If your test item takes one psychTestR page to administer,
\code{show_item} should be a function of the form
\code{function(item, state, ...) {...}}.
The \code{item} parameter will correspond to
a row of the \code{item_bank} data frame.
The \code{state} parameter (advanced use only)
allows the \code{show_item} function to access
additional information about the current psychTestR session,
e.g. local variables (see \code{\link[psychTestR]{get_local}}).
The function should return a psychTestR \code{\link[psychTestR]{page}}
displaying the test item and storing the response in \code{answer(state)};
psychTestR's built-in question functions
(e.g. \code{\link[psychTestR]{NAFC_page}})
do the latter automatically.
\item \strong{Multi-page items} -
If your test item takes multiple psychTestR pages to administer,
\code{show_item} should be a list of psychTestR test elements
or, equivalently, a psychTestR timeline as created by
\code{\link[psychTestR]{new_timeline}}).
Mutability is achieved by using reactive pages
(\code{\link[psychTestR]{reactive_page}}),
which can access the current value of \code{item} from
the psychTestR session state object as follows:
\code{psychTestR::get_local("item", state)}.
When the timeline completes, \code{answer(state)} must
be set to the participant's answer.
If several pages contribute to the final answer,
this may involve accumulating values in a temporary variable
(see \code{\link[psychTestR]{get_local}}
and \code{\link[psychTestR]{set_local}}).
}

psychTestR's built-in question functions
(e.g. \code{\link[psychTestR]{NAFC_page}})
by default save each response to the psychTestR results list.
This behaviour is unnecessary in \code{show_item},
because psychTestRCAT accumulates and saves its own store
of item-wise results.
It is therefore recommended to set \code{save_answer = FALSE}
in these question functions.}

\item{stopping_rule}{(Function)
A stopping rule for determining when the test should terminate,
as created by \code{\link{new_stopping_rule}}.
In the common case where the test terminates after a set number of items,
use \code{\link{stopping_rule.num_items}},
passing the number of items as a function parameter.}

\item{opt}{(List)
A list of further options as created by \code{\link{adapt_test_options}}.}
}
\value{
A psychTestR timeline representing the adaptive test.
Once the adaptive test is complete,
psychTestR saves three primary results into the results table:
\itemize{
\item \code{ability} - The participant's final ability estimate.
\item \code{ability_sem} - The standard error of the final ability estimate,
as computed from the IRT model.
\item \code{num_items} - The number of items administered to the participant.
}

Further information, in particular item-by-item results,
can be extracted from the \code{metadata} slot of the \code{ability} field.
This can be accessed by loading psychTestR RDS results files.
Alternatively, item-by-item results can be accessed
using the function \code{\link{compile_trial_by_trial_results}}.
}
\description{
Defines an adaptive test for use within psychTestR.
}
\details{
This is the top-level function of the psychTestRCAT package.
It defines adaptive tests within the framework of item response theory.
An adptive test is one that tailors item selection to the
current test-taker on the basis of their performance during the test.
}
\note{
By default, \code{adapt_test} displays no feedback to the
participant when they finish the test.
Use \code{\link{cat.feedback.graph}} directly after \code{adapt_test}
to display a feedback graph to the participant.

Ability estimation and item selection are performed using
the \code{catR} package.
